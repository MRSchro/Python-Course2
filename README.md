## 🤝 Contributing

This repo is primarily for personal learning, but PRs that fix typos or add elegant solutions are welcome.  
1. Fork → new branch → PR.  
2. Stick to **PEP 8** style; keep scripts runnable with plain Python 3 (no obscure deps).  
3. Add a short docstring explaining how to run your script.
